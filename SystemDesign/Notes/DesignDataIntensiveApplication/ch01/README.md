# Chapter 01, Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

### Three concerns
<ol>
    <li>Reliability</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The system should continue to work corectly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of <em>adversity</em> (hardware or software faults, and even human error)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Scalability</li>
    <ul>
        <li>As the system <em>grows</em> (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Maintainability</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new cases), and they should all be able to work on it <em>productively</em></li>
    </ul>
</ol>
