# Chapter 01 Why Event-Driven Microservices?

## What are Event-Driven Microservices?

Service-oriented architectures (SOAs) are often composed of multiple microservices synchronously communicating directly with one another.

## Introduction to Domain-Driven Design and Bounded Contexts

Concepts underpin domain-drive design:

<ul>
    <li>Domain</li>
    <li>Subdomain</li>
    <li>Domain (and Subdomain) Model</li>
    <li>Bounded Context</li>
</ul>
