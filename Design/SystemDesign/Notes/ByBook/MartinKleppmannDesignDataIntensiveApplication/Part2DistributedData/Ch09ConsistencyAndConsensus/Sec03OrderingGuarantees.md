# Chapter 09, Consistency and Consensus

## Section 02, Ordering Guarantees

### Ordering and Causality

#### The causal order is not a total order

#### Linearizability is stronger than causal consistency

#### Capturing causal dependencies

### Sequence Number Ordering

#### Noncausal sequence number generators

#### Lamport timestamps

#### Timestamp ordering is not sufficient

### Total Order Broadcast

#### Using total order broadcast

#### Implementing linearizable storage using total order broadcast

#### Implementing total order broadcast using linearizable storage
