<b>knowledge representation</b>

<b>object modeling</b>

<b>enhanced ER (EER)</b>

## 4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance

EER model includes ER model, concepts of subclass and superclass, specialization and generalization, a category of union type, which repsents a collection of objects/entities.

## 4.2 Speccialization and Generalizatin

### 4.2.1 Specialization

Specialization is the process of defining a set of subclasses of an entity type; this entity type is called the super class of the specialization.

### 4.2.2 Generalization

## 4.3 Constraints and Characteristics of Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies

### 4.3.1 Constraints on Specialization and Generalization

### 4.3.2 Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies and Lattices

### 4.3.3 Utilizing Specialization and Generalization in Refining Conceptual Schemas

## 4.4 Modeling of UNION Types Using Categories

## 4.5 A Sample University EER Schema, Design Choices, and Formal Definitions

### 4.5.1 A Different University Database Example

### 4.5.2 Design Choices for Specialization/Generalization

### 4.5.3 Formal Definitions for the EER Model Concepts

## 4.6 Example or Other Notation: Representing Specialization and Generalization in UML Class Diagram

## 4.7 Data Abstraction, Knowledge Representation, and Ontology Concepts

### 4.7.1 Classification and Instantiation

### 4.7.2 Identification

### 4.7.3 Specialization and Generalization

### 4.7.4 Aggregation and Association

<Aggregation> is an abstraction concept for building composite objects from their component objects.

The abstraction of <b>association</b> is used to associate objects from several <i>independent classes</i>.
