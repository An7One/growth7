# Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users

## 1.1 Introduction

A <b>database</b> is a collection of related data. By <b>data</b>, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning. <br/>

A <b>database management system (DBMS)</b> is a computerized system that enables users to the create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a <i>general-purpose software ssytem</i> that facilitates the process of <i>defining, constructing, manipulating,</i> and <i>sharding</i> databases among various user ans applications. <b>Defining</b> a database involves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database.

<b>meta-data</b>

<b>Constructing</b> the database is the process of storing the data on some storage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. <b>Manipulating</b> a database includes functions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the database to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. <b>Sharing</b> a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database simultaneously.

## 1.2 An Example

## 1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach

### 1.3.1 Self-Describing Nature of a Database System

### 1.3.2 Insulation between Programs and Data, and Data Abstraction

### 1.3.3 Support of Multiple Views of the Data

### 1.3.4 Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing

concurrency control

online trasaction processing (OLTP)

## 1.4 Actors on the Scene

### 1.4.1 Database Administratros

### 1.4.2 Database Designers

### 1.4.3 End Users

<b>End users</b> are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, updating, and generating reports.

<ul>
    <li>Casual end users</li>
    <li>Native or parametric end users</li>
    <li>Sophisticated end users</li>
    <li>Standalone users</li>
</ul>

### 1.4.4 System Analysts and Application Programmers (Software Engineers)

## 1.5 Workers behind the Scene

<ul>
    <li>DBMS system designers and implementers</li>
    <li>Tool developers</li>
    <li>Operators and maintenance personnel</li>
</ul>
